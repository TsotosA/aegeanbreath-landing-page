## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Aegean Breath ("the App", "we", "our") handles your information when you use our Android application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

Aegean Breath is a breath-holding training application designed for freediving and apnea enthusiasts. The App helps you track your training progress, create custom breathing tables, and monitor your performance.

## Our Privacy Commitment

## Information Storage and Use

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

The App stores the following information locally on your device:

#### 1. Training Data
- **Breathing Tables**: Custom CO2 tolerance tables, O2 adaptation tables, and user-defined training routines including preparation times, hold durations, number of rounds, and increment values
- **Session History**: Records of your training sessions including timestamps, session duration, session type, completion status, and optional personal notes
- **Performance Metrics**: Contraction timestamps during breath holds and your maximum breath-hold achievements
- **Heart Rate Data**: Heart rate measurements collected from connected Bluetooth devices during training sessions

#### 2. App Preferences
- **Display Settings**: Your chosen visual theme and appearance preferences
- **Audio/Haptic Settings**: Sound and vibration notification preferences
- **Training Preferences**: Settings such as 5-second increment options for table configuration
- **Onboarding Status**: Whether you have completed the initial app introduction

#### 3. Device Connection Information
- **Bluetooth Device Details**: Saved Bluetooth device addresses and names of heart rate monitors you have paired with the App for automatic reconnection

### Purpose of Data Collection

All data collected serves the following purposes:
- Tracking your breath-holding training progress over time
- Providing personalized training recommendations based on your performance
- Customizing your training experience with saved preferences
- Connecting to your heart rate monitor for health monitoring during training
- Improving your training effectiveness through historical data analysis

## Permissions Requested

The App requests the following device permissions:

### Bluetooth Permissions
- **Purpose**: To connect to and receive heart rate data from compatible Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) heart rate monitors
- **Permissions Used**:
  - `BLUETOOTH` - Basic Bluetooth functionality
  - `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN` - Bluetooth device management
  - `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` - Scanning for nearby Bluetooth devices (Android 12+)
  - `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` - Connecting to paired Bluetooth devices (Android 12+)
- **Data Handling**: Heart rate data received from connected devices is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted elsewhere

### Location Permission (Android 10 and Earlier Only)
- **Permission Used**: `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` (only on Android 10 and below)
- **Purpose**: Required by Android's operating system to scan for Bluetooth devices on older Android versions
- **Important Note**: The App does NOT collect, store, or use your location data. This permission is solely required by the Android OS for Bluetooth scanning on older devices and is explicitly flagged as "neverForLocation" on Android 12+

## Data Security

Your data security is important to us:

The App is suitable for users of all ages. Since we do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers, there are no special privacy considerations for users under the age of 13. All data remains on the user's device under the control of the device owner.

## Health and Safety

The App is designed as a training tool for breath-holding practice. Please note:

- Always practice in a safe environment (sitting or lying down)

The only external interaction is direct Bluetooth communication with heart rate monitors you explicitly choose to connect.
